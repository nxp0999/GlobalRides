## Core Challenge
The main complexity lies in managing **overlapping user roles** - where a single person can simultaneously be a Rider, Driver, Customer, and Restaurant Owner - along with intricate business relationships across multiple service domains.

## Key Components
1. **Multi-role User Management**: Users with overlapping roles (Driver + Restaurant Owner, etc.)
2. **Ride Services**: Driver-ride assignments, location-based pricing, payment processing
3. **Food Delivery**: Restaurant-menu-order relationships, delivery coordination
4. **Employee Hierarchy**: Platform Managers, Support Agents, Delivery Coordinators with training relationships
5. **Reviews & Analytics**: Cross-service rating system and business intelligence

## Technical Approach
- **EER Modeling** with superclass/subclass relationships to handle overlapping roles
- **Database Normalization** to eliminate redundancy
- **Complex SQL Implementation** with 25+ interconnected tables
- **Business Intelligence Views** for loyalty programs, performance analytics, and operational insights
